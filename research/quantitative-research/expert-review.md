# Expert review

The aim of expert review is to evaluate current products from a distinct perspective, and offer a user experience point of view. This approach judges the product in terms of *8trustworthiness, credibility, competency, reliability, design and style**.

It is a **heuristic approach** to understanding the product. And it is opinionated. Since heuristic review cannot be quantified, it has to be applied carefully.

##How to conduct expert review

> TODO: Explain how to carry out expert review. This might be quite simple, but offering some guidelines might help. Perhaps this kind of review is the sort of thing that we might offer to clients (like Aluana) as a component of our work, so some guidelines might be handy.

In order to make the review more accurate, you should pair it with other research, particularly quantitative research.
