# Journey mapping

We use this technique to discover different steps in the user's interaction with our product. The goal of the journey mapping is to put together a visual overview of all the different decisions our users need to take in order to use the product.

##Why use journey maps?

A good journey map allows us to immerse ourselves in the user's mind, and gain a birds-eye view of their interaction with the application. By mapping a potentially complex series of interactions, it can help us to see undeveloped sections and unveil new potential for improvements.

##How to create a journey map

In order to properly map the user journey we need to have an understanding how our product will work. Therefore this exercise is the best to be executed after the user research and basic wireframing tasks.
