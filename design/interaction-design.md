# Interaction design

Interaction design is about how you users interact with your product. Its goal is to make this interaction smooth and intuitive.

## Animations
Animations can make specific interactions easier to understood.

Interaction became a *big* thing when smart phones came into the picture. There are a huge variety of interactions you can apply to your design: double tap, pinch, swipe, 3-finger swipe, 3D touch and so on. This opened a new horizon in interaction design.

By now, we have well established interaction design patterns: when you pull down your e-mail client on your phone to update. This “pull down to refresh” became quite well-spread and most of the people become familiar with them.
