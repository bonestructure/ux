# Usability

TODO: Move bits of this page around. Some fit into design, and others are under measuring. Good starting points for deeper parts of other bits of the playbook.

Great product cannot live without great usability. You need to constantly pay attention to your users and study how they use your product. This allows you to unveil usability issues and fix them.

##How to improve usability
Basically any user research tool allows you to extract usability problems. The most common way of revealing issues are:
- **[Expert review](https://github.com/wearehanno/ux/wiki/Expert-review)**
- **[Analytics](https://github.com/wearehanno/ux/wiki/Analytics)**
- **[User testing](https://github.com/wearehanno/ux/wiki/User-testing)**

##Best practises
- **You have to test your product regularly**: without testing you can't discover real usability problems.
- **You can design certain actions to be hard to perform**: it is common to design something hard to use. Unfortunately this is an increasing trend amongst products, like LinkedIn, which is making it explicitly hard to cancel a subscription.
- **Consistency**:
- **Pay attention on the on-boarding process**: on-boarding users is especially important to keep your retention rate high.
- **Learnability**:
- **Study platform specific guidelines**: if you are designing for mobile/tablet [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/) and [Android](https://developer.android.com/design/index.html) guidelines are essential to provide native experience.

##When consider working on usability
Generally, improving usability shouldn't be a one-time session: you should look to improve your product constantly. In the meantime there are times when you need to especially consider focusing on usability:
- Creating a new product
- Redesigning existing product
- Adding new features to existing products
